"""
mascots.py — the LOCKED character bible for the course illustrations.

Single source of truth for every recurring mascot's appearance, so the cast stays
visually CONSISTENT between lectures and from one Claude Code session to the next.
gen_images.py imports SEREGA from here; the image-gate (_research/check_images.py)
imports MASCOTS + SEREGA_MIN_RATIO to enforce the brand rules below.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS — the brand drifted once already: Serega quietly faded out of
the recent units (L5→L6→L7→L8 went 5→3→0→0 plates with him) even though his look was
already pinned in gen_images.py. A written convention does not stop drift; a registry
+ a gate does. New lectures REUSE this cast; a genuinely new character is added by
locking an entry HERE FIRST — never by describing a recurring character ad-hoc in a
single brief (that is how a character starts to drift).

RULES (mechanically enforced by check_images.py):
  - Serega is the through-line narrator. Every lecture features him in a healthy share
    of plates (>= SEREGA_MIN_RATIO) AND in its hero (first) and final (last) plate.
  - GREEN appears ONLY on the green Tatar tübetey — worn by Serega (and by his
    Sir-Cosine costume). Nowhere else: every other character is bare-headed, no green.
  - Use the cast where it fits; introduce a new mascot only by adding a locked entry
    here, and only when a recurring on-brand character genuinely earns it.

# ── Serega — the host. Locked so he never drifts between images. Repeat the cap colour
#    3× and spell it three ways (deep-green, forest-green, #2F7D4F) to anchor whichever
#    token the model latches onto. (Imported verbatim by gen_images.build_prompt.) ──
SEREGA = (
    "The recurring character Serega is a round-headed stick figure with LONG BLACK wavy hair "
    "flowing to the shoulders, two simple dot eyes and a tiny smile, thin noodle arms and legs, "
    "and a plain COURSE-BLUE (#2A6FDB) tunic. CRITICAL HEADWEAR — read carefully: "
    "Serega wears a DEEP FOREST-GREEN (#2F7D4F) Tatar skullcap (called a 'tubeteika' or "
    "'tübetey'), shaped like a short flat-topped pillbox cap, sitting flat directly on top of "
    "the head (NEVER stacked on top of another hat/helmet/cap, NEVER perched over a second cap, "
    "NEVER worn alongside any other headwear — there is EXACTLY ONE skullcap on Serega and it is "
    "the green one), with a thin ochre/yellow geometric embroidered trim around the rim. The cap "
    "colour is GREEN — repeat: forest GREEN, not blue, not purple, not red, not patterned with "
    "blue. The cap is GREEN in EVERY single image, without exception, every time the character "
    "appears, in every pose, in every scene. Same character, same green cap, same hair, same "
    "tunic — identical across all illustrations in the course. "

# ── the rest of the recurring cast. Each entry's `appearance` is the locked spec to paste
#    into a brief when that character is used; `keywords` is how the gate spots the character
#    in a brief; `carries_green` is True ONLY for the green-cap wearers (Serega + Sir Cosine);
#    `palette` is the per-character colour note. Bare-headed creatures wear NO green. ──
